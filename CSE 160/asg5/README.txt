Requirements:
    3 different light sources:
        Ambient light
        Point light (yellow light on the opposite side of 3D model; much easier to see in second camera)
        Directional light (blue light that is tracking one of the orbiting blocks, and can be seen periodically across the terrain)
Extras for A:
    Multiple Cameras: Second observational camera on left
    Picking: Works much better when second camera is toggled off; click on blocks to delete them
    Fog: Indigo fog (only in main camera); much more apparent when moving away from platform

Misc Controls:
    Press 'c' to toggle on/off second camera and GUI for main camera
